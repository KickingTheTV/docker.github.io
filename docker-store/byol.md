## What is Bring Your Own License? (BYOL)?

Bring Your Own License (BYOL) allows customers with existing software licenses to easily migrate to the containerized version of the software you make available on Docker Store.

There are two types of BYOL plans available to ISVs:
- Ungated customer access to content: customers will be able to see and access an ISV's BYOL product listing by subscribing to the product using their Docker ID.
- Gated customer access to content: customers will be able to see an ISV's BYOL product listing, but will not be entitled to the content until the ISV creates an order for their product via Docker Store APIs. A product key will be generated by Docker Store and given back to the ISV. The ISV can then send this product key to the customer they wish to entitle. After fulfilling the order to a specific Docker ID, the customer will be able to access the previously gated BYOL content.

ISVs can use the Docker Store/Hub as an entitlement and distribution platform. Using API’s provided by Docker, ISVs can entitle users and distribute their Dockerized content to many different audiences:
- Existing customers that want their existing licensed software made available as Docker containers.
- New customers that are only interested in consuming their software as Docker containers.
- Trial or beta customers, where the ISV can distribute feature or time limited software.

Docker provides a fulfillment service so that ISV's can programmatically entitle users, by creating subscriptions to their content in Docker Store.

## Ungated BYOL

### Prerequisites and Setup

To use Docker as your fulfillment service, an ISV must:
- Apply and be approved as a Docker Store Publisher
- Apply and be approved to list an Ungated BYOL product
- Create one or more Ungated BYOL product plans, in the Docker Store Publisher center.

## Creating an Ungated BYOL Plan

In Plans & Pricing section of the Publisher Center, ensure the following:
- Price/Month should be set to $0
- There should be no free trial associated with the product
- Under the Pull Requirements dropdown, "Subscribed users only" should be selected.

## Gated BYOL

### Prerequisites and Setup

To use Docker Store as your fulfillment service, an ISV must:
- Apply and be approved as a Docker Store Publisher.
- Apply and be approved to use the Gated BYOL feature.
- Create a BYOL, "bring your own license" plans, in the Docker Store Publisher center.

Docker will provide:
- One or more authorization tokens to the publisher that they will use when making API requests to the Docker fulfillment service.
- A partner identifier.

### Fulfillment and Orders Usage

Docker provides an API that ISV's will use to create orders for their products, and to obtain "access tokens" that they distribute to their users/customers/prospects, which in turn can be exchanged for a subscription to the ISV's products on Docker Store. ISV's will be able to access reports and usage information about their products on Docker Store.

Once an ISV has created the BYOL plan, these steps detail how ISV's grant users entitlement to their Docker Store products:
1. A user interacts with the ISV, and the ISV wants the user to consume their software/product in Dockerized form. This could be:
    - A new customer purchasing software from the ISV for the first time.
    - An existing customer that the ISV wants to grant access to the Dockerized form of their content.
    - A prospect, where the ISV wants to give them access to Dockerized content, but for a limited duration, or to a reduced feature version of their product.
2. The ISV will issue a "Create Order" API request to the Docker fulfillment service. The request will include the specific BYOL plan, any required quantities, and (optionally) any product keys that the ISV's software requires.
3. On success, the fulfillment service will return 2 pieces of information: an order id for the ISV's internal records, and an access token (in url form) that can be given to the user.
4. The ISV can distribute the access token/url to the user in whatever form works with their sales flow - at the end of a UI purchase flow, in a follow up email, etc.
5. The user takes the access token/url, and navigates to it. The user will be taken to a procurement page on Docker Store, where they will be prompted to either sign in with an existing Docker identity, or will have the option to create one.
6. The user is then shown information on the order, including a description of the product & quantities, and any terms & conditions that the ISV has specified.
7. If the user agrees to the ISV's terms, they will accept the order. A subscription is created to the appropriate plan, for the duration specified in the order.
8. The user can now access the Docker image as any other subscription on Docker store: on the host where they will obtain the image, they will need to issue a "docker login" with the credentials to the Docker identity that owns the subscription.
9. Once logged in, the use can issue a "docker pull" to download the image to their host.
10. If needed by the ISV's software, the user can obtain the product key for their subscription from Docker Store, and enter it into the ISV's container, following instructions provided by the ISV.

A publisher may change or cancel an order before it is fulfilled by the user, if needed, using the "Update Order" API request documented below. Once the order has been fulfilled, the ISV can make changes or cancel the corresponding subscription by making requests to the Store billing service.

The subscription that a user receives at the end of this process will appear along with their other subscriptions in Docker Store. However, the user will not be able to directly change or cancel it, since it represents an entitlement under the control of the ISV. The Store UI will direct the user to contact the ISV for any desired changes.

### Product Keys

If an ISV's software uses product keys, these may be supplied at the time of order creation. Once the order has been fulfilled, the product keys will be available to the user from the user's subscription detail page. The ISV's installation documentation should refer the user to look for the keys there.

### API Usage

An approved ISV only needs to make a single API request to create an order & obtain an access token for a user, the "Create Order" request documented below. Other API requests are needed only if the ISV need to alter/cancel the order, or lookup information about the order after it has been created. 

### Gated BYOL Plan Setup

Once a publisher has been onboarded to create an gated byol plan, the publisher center will begin to allow them to setup a new, unpublished plan with the gated byol option:

![byol plan](images/publish_byol.png)

In this stage of the publisher flow, note the **Pull Requirements** selection as "Bring your own License", as well as the **Tier Description** which should include an external reference to where a customer must go to acquire their license from the publisher.

# API Reference for ISVs

## Endpoint, Authorization, Content

All API requests should be made to:

    <https://store.docker.com/api/fulfillment/v1/...>

For example, the full path for the "Create Order" api will a POST to:

    https://store.docker.com/api/fulfillment/v1/orders

All API requests to the fulfillment service must have an "Authorization: Bearer" header with an authorization string that will be provided by Docker. An example header is:

    Authorization: Bearer 9043ea5c-172a-4d4b-b255-a1dab96fb631

ISV's should closely protect their authorization token as if were a password, and alert Docker if it has been compromised or needs replacement.

All request and response bodies must/will be encoded with JSON using UTF-8.
